\b0\fs22 Version 3, 29 June 2007\par
Copyright (C) 2007 {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://fsf.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf1\ul Free Software Foundation, Inc.}}}}\f0\fs22\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\line document, but changing it is not allowed.\par
\b\fs28 Preamble\par
\b0\fs22 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and\line other kinds of works.\par
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take\line away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General\line Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all\line versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\line We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most\line of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its\line authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\par
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\line General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\line distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you\line receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the\line software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do\line these things.\par
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights\line or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain\line responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:\line responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\par
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\line a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.\line You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you\line must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360 1.\tab assert copyright on the software, and\par
2.\tab offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute\line and/or modify it.\par

\pard\sa180 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that\line there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake,\line the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their\line problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\par
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified\line versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This\line is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to\line change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of\line products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most\line unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit\line the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other\line domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future\line versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\par
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States\line should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on\line general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special\line danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively\line proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to\line render the program non-free.\par
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\line follow.\par
\b\fs28 TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\fs24 0. Definitions.\par
\b0\i\fs22 This License\i0  refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\par
\i Copyright\i0  also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,\line such as semiconductor masks.\par
\i The Program\i0  refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\line Each licensee is addressed as \i you\i0 . \i Licensees\i0  and \i recipients\i0  may be\line individuals or organizations.\par
To \i modify\i0  a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a\line fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.\line The resulting work is called a \i modified version\i0  of the earlier work or a work\line\i based on\i0  the earlier work.\par
A \i covered work\i0  means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the\line Program.\par
To \i propagate\i0  a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,\line would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable\line copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.\line Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\line making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\par
To \i convey\i0  a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to\line make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer\line network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\par
An interactive user interface displays \i Appropriate Legal Notices\i0  to the\line extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360 1.\tab displays an appropriate copyright notice, and\par
2.\tab tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\line extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work\line under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.\par

\pard\sa180 If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a\line prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\par
\b\fs24 1. Source Code.\par
\b0\fs22 The \i source code\i0  for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\line modifications to it. \i Object code\i0  means any non-source form of a work.\par
A \i Standard Interface\i0  means an interface that either is an official standard\line defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified\line for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers\line working in that language.\par
The \i System Libraries\i0  of an executable work include anything, other than the\line work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major\line Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only\line to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard\line Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code\line form. A \i Major Component\i0 , in this context, means a major essential component\line (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on\line which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an\line object code interpreter used to run it.\par
The \i Corresponding Source\i0  for a work in object code form means all the source\line code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object\line code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.\line However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose\line tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in\line performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,\line Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source\line files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\line linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as\line by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and\line other parts of the work.\par
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate\line automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\par
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\par
\b\fs24 2. Basic Permissions.\par
\b0\fs22 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on\line the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This\line License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified\line Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only\line if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License\line acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by\line copyright law.\par
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\line conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey\line covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications\line exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,\line provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all\line material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running\line the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your\line direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\line your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\par
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\line conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it\line unnecessary.\par
\b\fs24 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\par
\b0\fs22 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\line under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO\line copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or\line restricting circumvention of such measures.\par
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\line circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is\line effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered\line work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the\line work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'\line legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\par
\b\fs24 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\par
\b0\fs22 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,\line in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on\line each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that\line this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply\line to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give\line all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\par
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may\line offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\par
\b\fs24 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\par
\b0\fs22 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it\line from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,\line provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360\bullet\tab a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and\line giving a relevant date.\par
\bullet\tab b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under\line this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement\line modifies the requirement in section 4 to \i keep intact all notices\i0 .\par
\bullet\tab c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to\line anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore\line apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole\line of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This\line License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it\line does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\par
\bullet\tab d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\line Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\line interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need\line not make them do so.\par

\pard\sa180 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,\line which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not\line combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a\line storage or distribution medium, is called an \i aggregate\i0  if the compilation and\line its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the\line compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a\line covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\line parts of the aggregate.\par
\b\fs24 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\par
\b0\fs22 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4\line and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source\line under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360\bullet\tab a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\line a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source\line fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software\line interchange.\par
\bullet\tab b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including\line a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for\line at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or\line customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the\line object code either\par

\pard\fi-360\li720\sa180\tx360 1.\tab a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product\line that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium\line customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your\line reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or\par
2.\tab access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no\line charge.\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360\bullet\tab c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\line offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only\line occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code\line with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\par
\bullet\tab d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place\line (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding\line Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You\line need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the\line object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the\line Corresponding Source may be on a different server operated by you or a\line third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you\line maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\line Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding\line Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as\line needed to satisfy these requirements.\par
\bullet\tab e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\line inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the\line work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection\line 6d.\par

\pard\sa180 A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the\line Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the\line object code work.\par
A \i User Product\i0  is either\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360 1.\tab a \i consumer product\i0 , which means any tangible personal property which is\line normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or\par
2.\tab anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.\par

\pard\sa180 In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be\line resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a\line particular user, \i normally used\i0  refers to a typical or common use of that\line class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\line in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,\line the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product\line has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses\line represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\par
\i Installation Information\i0  for a User Product means any methods, procedures,\line authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute\line modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified\line version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure\line that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case\line prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\par
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\line specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a\line transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is\line transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of\line how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under\line this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this\line requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the\line ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the\line work has been installed in ROM).\par
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\line requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a\line work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User\line Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be\line denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the\line operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication\line across the network.\par
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord\line with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an\line implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require\line no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\par
\b\fs24 7. Additional Terms.\par
\b0\i\fs22 Additional permissions\i0  are terms that supplement the terms of this License by\line making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions\line that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were\line included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable\line law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may\line be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains\line governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\par
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\line additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional\line permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when\line you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added\line by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright\line permission.\par
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a\line covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\line supplement the terms of this License with terms:\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360\bullet\tab a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of\line sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\par
\bullet\tab b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\line attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed\line by works containing it; or\par
\bullet\tab c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\line requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable\line ways as different from the original version; or\par
\bullet\tab d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors\line of the material; or\par
\bullet\tab e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade\line names, trademarks, or service marks; or\par
\bullet\tab f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by\line anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with\line contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability\line that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and\line authors.\par

\pard\sa180 All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \i further restrictions\i0\line within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any\line part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along\line with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a\line license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or\line conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed\line by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction\line does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\par
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,\line in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to\line those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\par
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a\line separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements\line apply either way.\par
\b\fs24 8. Termination.\par
\b0\fs22 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided\line under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,\line and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any\line patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\par
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a\line particular copyright holder is reinstated\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360\bullet\tab a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\line finally terminates your license, and\par
\bullet\tab b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the\line violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\par

\pard\sa180 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\line permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some\line reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation\line of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the\line violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\par
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses\line of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If\line your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not\line qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\par
\b\fs24 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\par
\b0\fs22 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy\line of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a\line consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does\line not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you\line permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe\line copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or\line propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do\line so.\par
\b\fs24 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\par
\b0\fs22 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a\line license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,\line subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\line third parties with this License.\par
An \i entity transaction\i0  is a transaction transferring control of an\line organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\line organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work\line results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives\line a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's\line predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a\line right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\line predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with\line reasonable efforts.\par
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights\line granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a\line license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this\line License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or\line counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by\line making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any\line portion of it.\par
\b\fs24 11. Patents.\par
\b0\fs22 A \i contributor\i0  is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of\line the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is\line called the contributor's \i contributor version\i0 .\par
A contributor's \i essential patent claims\i0  are all patent claims owned or\line controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,\line that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,\line using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would\line be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor\line version. For purposes of this definition, \i control\i0  includes the right to grant\line patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this\line License.\par
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\line license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,\line offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of\line its contributor version.\par
In the following three paragraphs, a \i patent license\i0  is any express agreement\line or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express\line permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent\line infringement). To \i grant\i0  such a patent license to a party means to make such\line an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\par
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the\line Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of\line charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available\line network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360 1.\tab cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or\par
2.\tab arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this\line particular work, or\par
3.\tab arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to\line extend the patent license to downstream recipients.\par

\pard\sa180\i Knowingly relying\i0  means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent\line license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use\line of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable\line patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\par
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you\line convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a\line patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing\line them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,\line then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients\line of the covered work and works based on it.\par
A patent license is \i discriminatory\i0  if it does not include within the scope of\line its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise\line of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.\line You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a\line third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you\line make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of\line conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\line parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\line license\par

\pard\fi-360\li360\sa180\tx360\bullet\tab a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\line made from those copies), or\par
\bullet\tab b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations\line that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or\line that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\par

\pard\sa180 Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\line license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to\line you under applicable patent law.\par
\b\fs24 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\par
\b0\fs22 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\line otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse\line you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so\line as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other\line pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For\line example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for\line further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you\line could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\line from conveying the Program.\par
\b\fs24 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\par
\b0\fs22 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to\line link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the\line GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey\line the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the\line part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero\line General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network\line will apply to the combination as such.\par
\b\fs24 14. Revised Versions of this License.\par
\b0\fs22 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU\line General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\line spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\line or concerns.\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\line that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \i or any later\line version\i0  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\line conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by\line the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number\line of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by\line the Free Software Foundation.\par
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the\line GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of\line acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for\line the Program.\par
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.\line However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright\line holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\par
\b\fs24 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\par
\b0\fs22 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\line LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER\line PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \i AS IS\i0  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\line EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\line MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\line QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\line DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\line CORRECTION.\par
\b\fs24 16. Limitation of Liability.\par
\b0\fs22 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\line COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS\line PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\line INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE\line THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\line INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE\line PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY\line HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\par
\b\fs24 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\par
\b0\fs22 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot\line be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall\line apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil\line liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of\line liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\par
\b\fs28 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par
\fs24 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\par
\b0\fs22 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\line use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\line which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\par
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\line them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion\line of warranty; and each file should have at least the \i copyright\i0  line and a\line pointer to where the full notice is found.\par
\f1 <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\line Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line\line This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\line it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\line the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\line (at your option) any later version.\line\line This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\line but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\line MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\line GNU General Public License for more details.\line\line You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\line along with this program.  If not, see <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/"}}{\fldrslt{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f1\fs22 >.\par
\f0 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like\line this when it starts in an interactive mode:\par
\f1 <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\line This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\line This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\line under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\par
\f0 The hypothetical commands \f1 show w\f0  and \f1 show c\f0  should show the appropriate\line parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might\line be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \i about box\i0 .\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if\line any, to sign a \i copyright disclaimer\i0  for the program, if necessary. For more\line information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\line {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ }}{\fldrslt{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .\par
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\line proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider\line it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If\line this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead\line of this License. But first, please read\line {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html }}{\fldrslt{http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs22 .\par
